jocations-of-interest vs locations-of-interest or jovid vs covid

A for fun Cesium 3D map experiment and basic Chart.js chart created during the initial august 2021 outbreak using government data and and some (now out of date) data from a friend

partially written in functional style for robustness and re-use particularly util.js
makes use of ES6+ map and reduce style data processing functions in main.js

## todo

- unfinished line visualisation of location events by time (currently just shows them linked together one after the other and not yet visually helpful)
- improve reduce accObj so it collects more information per city
- seperate data-cleaning functionality from chart functionality
- improve UX - site title/heading, explain covid-chart & jovid-map
- functionalise data congestion and distrobution to chart/map functions
